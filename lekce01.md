## What is DevOps
There are many definitions of what does the term DevOps mean, since it can be ambiguous and when you ask 10 different people, each might come up with their own explanation.

But, let's go down to earth and start with what is the mainstream definition of the word DevOps:
> **DevOps is the software engineering culture that is aimed at unification and cooperation of two major players in IT - Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops).**

What is nice about DevOps is that it includes:
 * shorter development cycles (similar to agile development)
 * that means increased frequency of deployments
 * dependable releases, in alignment with business goals

It also strongly advocates for automation and monitoring of all steps in software development:
 * integration
 * testing
 * releasing
 * deployment
 * infrastructure management
